**What is Texas Holdem?**

Texas Holdem is a modified version of the card texasHoldem poker. Two cards, known as hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street"). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards; the five community cards and their two hole cards. Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal. The player who has the best hand and has not folded by the end of all betting rounds wins all of the money bet for the hand, known as the pot.

**Why Texas Holdem?**

This Texas Holdem project is a non-academic project that I designed to build on my object-oriented design skills. I also enjoy coding in Java. My approach for this project was to take a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design approach. My selection for this approach was because I wanted to create a project that was flexible enough to implement changes in the future. Specifically my goal is to make changes to the user interface of this game. At this time, the game plays out of the terminal. The next phase of this project will be to build the UI of this project using JavaFX. My ultimate goal is to make this gamea running web application.
