**How to run the program**

* To run the program you can just type **make** or **make all**. There are two
seperate make files you will need to run the make files independly. 
The client side had the nice action side to it! The server is nice as well
but not as nice at the client side.  


**What was your favorite part of the assignment?**
I liked this assignment! Seeing the two computers talk with each other. This
was my favorite assignment.
