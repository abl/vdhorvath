**How to build and run the code**

The files that we are looking at for submission one 
are primarly in deck.c. To run the file you will need type make 
at the terminal. 

An example of the input and output

*The input* 

We are not given an input, we are building a deck of cards. 

*The output*

Our output is a deck of cards.

**Explain the difference between memory on the stack vs heap memory**

Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation, both stored in the computer's RAM .


**External libraries the code relies on**
<stdlib.h>
 


**A summary of the project**

The project that I am building is the NEUchre card game.This card game is a 2-player version of a game called Euchre (pronounced "U-ker").
To get a sense of the game, you can play the traditional version at https://cardgames.io/euchre/


This project is the second biggest thing I have put together other than othello in 5001. I am a bit intimated by this assignment because I am not super comfortable in C. 
However, I think the assignment is cool and will push me to be more comfortable in the language.
